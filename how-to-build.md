## Prepare your build environment

Make sure you have yarn/npm, git and golang installed on your system. 

### Windows

Install from [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

```pwsh
scoop install yarn go
```

You don't need to install git again because scoop will ask you to install git at before.

If you want to compile v2rayA with PowerShell script, it is recommended that you install PowerShell Core. PowerShell Core can be downloaded [from GitHub](https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=stable) or [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/p/powershell/9mz1snwt0n5d).

### Linux

### macOS

```bash
brew install git yarn go 
```

You can build v2rayA with bash script. However, if you want to compile v2rayA with PowerShell script, you should install PowerShell Core first. PowerShell Core can be downloaded  [from GitHub](https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=stable).

## Build with script

### Bash script

Bash script runs on UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or macOS.

Open a terminal and `cd` to the path where v2rayA source localed, then run `bash ./build.sh`

### PowerShell script
